# Building-a-pyramid-in-Python
This program takes an integers number from the user (total number of blocks) and computes the height of the pyramid that can be build using those blocks

Listen to this story: a boy and his father, a computer programmer, are playing with wooden blocks. They are building a pyramid.

Their pyramid is a bit weird, as it is actually a pyramid-shaped wall – it's flat. The pyramid is stacked according to one simple principle: each lower layer contains one block more than the layer above.

The figure illustrates the rule used by the builders:

The task is to write a program which reads the number of blocks the builders have, and outputs the height of the pyramid that can be built using these blocks.

Note: the height is measured by the number of fully completed layers – if the builders don't have a sufficient number of blocks and cannot complete the next layer, they finish their work immediately.
